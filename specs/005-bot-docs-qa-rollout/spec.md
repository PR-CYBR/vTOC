# Bot Documentation, QA, and Rollout Spec

## Summary
Coordinate documentation updates, QA automation, and rollout planning for the multi-bot initiative. This work stitches together shared runtime deliverables and platform-specific bots to ensure operators, contributors, and SRE teams have clear guidance.

## Goals
- Update architecture and deployment diagrams reflecting Telegram, Slack, and Discord bots plus shared infrastructure.
- Extend contributor/operator documentation with setup steps, security expectations, and troubleshooting guides.
- Add automated verification (unit, integration, contract tests) covering shared utilities and platform-specific handlers.
- Produce end-to-end validation playbooks and rollout checklists for local, staging, and production environments.

## Non-Goals
- Implement bot code (covered by other specs).
- Replace existing governance policies for documentation approval or release managementâ€”this spec adapts them for the bot initiative.

## Scope & Deliverables
- Documentation updates across `docs/` with cross-links to Spec Kit assets.
- QA automation plan including CI workflows, integration test suites, and telemetry validation scripts.
- Rollout playbook covering secrets provisioning, feature flags, monitoring, and success metrics.
- Post-launch support plan and retrospection checklist.

## Architecture Overview
- Documentation focuses on multi-service topology: shared runtime package consumed by Telegram/Slack/Discord services deployed via Docker Compose and Fly.io.
- QA automation integrates with existing GitHub Actions workflows, leveraging `pnpm` scripts and Supabase test harnesses.
- Rollout plan coordinates with infrastructure teams for secret management (Doppler/Fly) and observability stack (OTEL + Supabase dashboards).

## Milestones
1. Architecture and deployment diagrams updated with shared + platform-specific components.
2. Contributor/operator documentation refreshed and cross-linked to Spec Kit directories.
3. QA automation (tests + CI workflows) implemented and passing.
4. Rollout playbook finalized with stakeholder sign-off.

## Open Questions & Clarifications
Legacy `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers are resolved; remaining gaps (e.g., final success metrics) will be captured in plan tasks.
