# Research Notes

## Existing Documentation
- `docs/tasks/bot-integrations.md` (legacy plan) – serves as baseline for new Spec Kit assets.
- `docs/workflows/` – describes GitHub Actions automations relevant to QA updates.
- `docs/backlog.md` – backlog governance; needs migration guidance for new spec directories.

## Tooling & Automation
- GitHub Actions workflows for `pnpm` lint/test provide starting point for bot CI tasks.
- Supabase telemetry dashboards and OTEL collector docs inform monitoring instructions.
- Release management templates from previous initiatives (search `docs/communications/`) can be adapted for rollout announcements.

## Outstanding Questions
- Determine which diagramming tooling (Mermaid vs Figma) to use for updated architecture visuals.
- Confirm QA resource availability to maintain integration test fixtures.
- Align rollout checkpoints with security and compliance review schedules.
