# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 – Documentation Audit
- Inventory existing docs covering ChatKit, AgentKit, and operations to identify gaps.
- Draft updated architecture diagrams showing shared runtime plus platform-specific bots.
- Propose documentation structure aligning with new `specs/` directories.

## Phase 2 – Contributor & Operator Guides
- Update contributor onboarding with steps to work on bot services (pnpm commands, environment setup).
- Expand operator runbooks for Telegram, Slack, and Discord bots, referencing respective quickstarts.
- Document security expectations: secrets handling, RBAC, audit logging.

## Phase 3 – QA Automation
- Define CI workflows for bot packages (lint, test, integration) leveraging shared runtime utilities.
- Implement contract tests validating telemetry schema and command responses using recorded fixtures.
- Integrate tests into existing GitHub Actions pipelines with dashboards for pass/fail history.

## Phase 4 – Rollout Playbooks
- Build staged rollout checklist covering secrets provisioning, change management approvals, and monitoring setup.
- Create validation scripts for local docker-compose, staging Fly apps, and production readiness checks.
- Document incident response procedures and escalation paths post-launch.

## Phase 5 – Adoption & Maintenance
- Publish migration notes in `docs/backlog.md` and communicate changes to contributors.
- Schedule knowledge-share sessions and maintain FAQ for new bot contributors.
- Establish review cadence to keep docs aligned with code changes (quarterly audits).
