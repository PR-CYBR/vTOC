# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 – Command Manifest & Permissions
- Define slash commands (`/mission`, `/playbook`, `/diagnostics`, `/alerts`) with required options.
- Identify guild roles permitted to invoke each command and document enforcement rules.
- Register commands via Discord REST API and confirm with staging guild admins.

## Phase 2 – Gateway & Connection Management
- Implement gateway client using Discord.js with intents for guild messages, interactions, and presence as needed.
- Add reconnect strategy with exponential backoff and jitter; persist session/resume tokens securely.
- Provide health/metrics instrumentation for connection status.

## Phase 3 – Command Handlers
- Build handler modules that call shared ChatKit, AgentKit, and MCP clients.
- Support pagination via follow-up messages and ephemeral responses for sensitive data.
- Implement long-running operation workflow (initial ack + progress updates).

## Phase 4 – Observability & Compliance
- Instrument OTEL spans (`discord.command`, `discord.event`) and metrics (command latency, error rate).
- Ensure rate limit headers are honored; add circuit breakers for repeated 429s.
- Validate audit logging requirements for command usage.

## Phase 5 – Deployment & Rollout
- Create Docker Compose and Fly.io configurations with secrets management guidance.
- Document guild onboarding steps (app registration, invite links, permissions).
- Run staging validation with operations stakeholders and capture sign-off before production launch.
