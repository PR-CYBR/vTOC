# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 – App Registration
- Draft Slack app manifest including required scopes (channels:history, chat:write, commands, events:read).
- Submit manifest for workspace admin approval and document review feedback.
- Configure signing secrets, bot tokens, and event subscriptions for monitored channels.

## Phase 2 – Events Listener
- Implement Express-based `/slack/events` endpoint using shared runtime server bootstrap.
- Add request verification (timestamp tolerance, signature check) and retry logic for HTTP 5xx responses.
- Create local tunnel tooling for manual event testing.

## Phase 3 – Message Processing Pipeline
- Design normalization schema mapping Slack events to Supabase telemetry tables.
- Implement processors for message creation, edits, reactions, and thread replies with deduplication.
- Integrate ChatKit notifications for high-severity keywords or mentions.

## Phase 4 – Slash Commands & Interactions
- Implement `/vtoc-status` and `/vtoc-help` commands to surface mission snapshots.
- Provide interactive message support (buttons, modals) for acknowledging alerts.
- Ensure responses respect Slack rate limits and ephemeral vs public message behaviors.

## Phase 5 – Observability & Rollout
- Instrument OTEL spans, structured logs, and metrics (event throughput, processing latency).
- Add integration tests using recorded Slack events and contract tests for Supabase writes.
- Publish runbooks covering deployment, credential rotation, and incident response; execute staging rehearsal.
