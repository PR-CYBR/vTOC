# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 – Command Design
- Gather operator use cases (mission status, runbooks, MCP checks) and convert into discrete commands.
- Define response templates, success metrics, and escalation flows for unsupported commands.
- Align authorization requirements with security (operator allow list, rate limits, audit logging).

## Phase 2 – Transport & Infrastructure
- Choose webhook vs polling strategy; implement webhook handler backed by Express and Telegram SDK.
- Provision Fly.io app with HTTPS endpoint; configure secret management and TLS certificates.
- Provide local Compose service that runs polling loop, along with ngrok instructions for webhook testing.

## Phase 3 – Command Handlers & Integrations
- Implement handlers invoking shared ChatKit, AgentKit, and MCP clients.
- Add caching for mission status queries and fan-out responses to long-running operations (progress updates).
- Implement error handling, retries, and operator notifications for degraded dependencies.

## Phase 4 – Quality & Observability
- Create integration tests using Telegram sandbox fixtures.
- Add structured logging fields for operator ID, command name, and downstream latency.
- Ensure OTEL spans propagate through shared runtime and annotate Telegram-specific attributes.

## Phase 5 – Documentation & Rollout
- Write operator quickstart, token provisioning guide, and runbooks for common incidents.
- Conduct staging rehearsal with real command flows and capture sign-off.
- Schedule production rollout with change management review.
