# Contributing to vTOC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to vTOC! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a positive environment
- Follow project standards and conventions

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vTOC.git
cd vTOC
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start development services
docker-compose up -d

# Or for local development
make dev-backend  # Terminal 1
make dev-frontend # Terminal 2
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 4. Keep your branch active

We automatically clean up long-lived feature branches to keep the repository tidy. A scheduled workflow runs every day at 03:00 UTC and deletes branches that:

- Have not received any commits in the last 30 days (the default retention window).
- Are not protected (e.g., `main`, `live`, or `release/*` branches).
- Do not opt out of cleanup.

The retention window and protected branch list can be tuned when running the workflow manually via **Actions â†’ "Cleanup stale branches" â†’ Run workflow**. The scheduled run uses the defaults above.

#### Opt out of automated cleanup

If you need to keep a branch around longer, you have two options:

1. **Use an opt-out prefix.** Branches whose names start with `keep/` or `keep-` are skipped by the cleanup job.
2. **Run the workflow manually** with a longer retention period while your branch remains active.

Please remove the `keep/` or `keep-` prefix once the branch is ready to be cleaned up, so the automation can resume managing it.

## Development Guidelines

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)

**Structure:**
```
backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routers/      # API endpoints
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models.py     # Database models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ database.py   # Database configuration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.py       # Application entry point
â””â”€â”€ tests/            # Test files
```

**Standards:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for functions
- Add unit tests for new features
- Use async/await for I/O operations

**Example:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from typing import List

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/items/", response_model=List[Item])
async def list_items() -> List[Item]:
    """List all items.
    
    Returns:
        List[Item]: List of all items
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Frontend (React)

**Structure:**
```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/        # Page components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/     # API services
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.js        # Main app component
â””â”€â”€ public/           # Static assets
```

**Standards:**
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful component names
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript

**Example:**
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

### Database Changes

**Migrations:**
```bash
# Create migration
docker-compose exec backend alembic revision -m "Description"

# Apply migration
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

**Guidelines:**
- Always create migrations for schema changes
- Test migrations both up and down
- Document breaking changes

### Automation Agents

**Structure:**
```
agents/
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/          # Agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ config/           # Configuration files
â””â”€â”€ agent_service.py  # Main service
```

**Guidelines:**
- Create focused, single-purpose agents
- Use proper logging
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document configuration options

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-backend

# Run specific test
docker-compose exec backend pytest tests/test_operations.py

# With coverage
docker-compose exec backend pytest --cov=app
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test-frontend

# Run in watch mode
cd frontend && npm test
```

### Integration Tests

Test the full stack:
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Test API
curl http://localhost/api/health

# Test frontend
curl -I http://localhost
```
