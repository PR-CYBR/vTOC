# vTOC - Virtual Tactical Operations Center

A modular, cloud-native tactical operations management platform built with microservice architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture

vTOC is built using a modern microservice architecture with the following components:

- **Backend API**: Python/FastAPI microservices for business logic
- **Frontend**: React single-page application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik for routing and load balancing
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n for automated workflows
- **Security Monitoring**: Wazuh for runtime security
- **Agent System**: Python-based automation agents
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for provisioning
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible for deployment automation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- (Optional) Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PR-CYBR/vTOC.git
cd vTOC
```

2. Copy the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and configure your environment variables (especially change default passwords)

4. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access the application:
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost
   - **API Documentation**: http://localhost/api/docs
   - **Traefik Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
   - **n8n Workflows**: http://localhost/n8n

## 📦 Services

### Backend API

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides RESTful APIs for:

- **Operations**: Manage tactical operations
- **Missions**: Track mission objectives
- **Assets**: Manage resources and equipment
- **Intelligence**: Store and analyze intelligence reports
- **Agents**: Control automation agents

API Documentation is available at `/api/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/api/redoc` (ReDoc).

### Frontend

React-based single-page application with:

- Dashboard with real-time statistics
- Immersive geospatial dashboard with live telemetry map overlays
- Operations management
- Mission tracking
- Asset inventory
- Intelligence reports
- Agent monitoring and control

### Database

PostgreSQL database with:

- Automated initialization scripts
- Data persistence via Docker volumes
- Connection pooling
- Database migrations support

### Traefik Reverse Proxy

- Automatic service discovery
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination support
- Dashboard for monitoring routes

### n8n Workflow Automation

Pre-configured workflows:

- **Operations Monitor**: Scheduled monitoring of active operations
- **Security Alert Handler**: Automated security alert processing

### Automation Agents

Three types of agents:

1. **Monitor Agent**: System health and metrics monitoring
2. **Analyzer Agent**: Intelligence and mission data analysis
3. **Executor Agent**: Automated task execution

## 🛠️ Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### Map configuration

The dashboard map is powered by [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) through `react-leaflet`. To enable the map and telemetry overlays:

1. Ensure the frontend is configured with the API endpoint that serves telemetry data using the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable.
2. Provide backend telemetry endpoints at:
   - `GET /telemetry/assets/` — returns an array of asset objects with latitude/longitude (and optional `heading`, `speed`, `status`, `source`).
   - `GET /telemetry/tracks/` — returns an array of track objects containing a `points`/`coordinates` collection with latitude/longitude pairs and an optional `source` identifier.
3. Each unique `source` value is presented as a toggleable layer on the map, allowing operators to control visibility per feed.

If your telemetry payloads use different field names, adjust the adapter in `frontend/src/services/telemetryAdapter.js` to normalise them before they reach the map component.

### Running Tests

Backend:
```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform

Deploy infrastructure:

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Ansible

Deploy using Ansible:

```bash
cd infrastructure/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/deploy.yml
```

## 🔒 Security

### Built-in Security Features

- **Wazuh**: Runtime security monitoring and intrusion detection
- **Snyk**: Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Traefik**: Secure routing with middleware support
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data management
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access

### Security Best Practices

1. Change all default passwords in `.env`
2. Use strong API secret keys
3. Enable SSL/TLS in production
4. Regularly update dependencies
5. Review security alerts from Wazuh and Snyk

## 🔄 CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows:

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Security Scan**: Daily security vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Review**: Automated dependency updates

## 📊 Monitoring

- **Traefik Dashboard**: Service health and routing
- **n8n Dashboard**: Workflow execution status
- **Wazuh Manager**: Security events and alerts
- **Agent Logs**: Automation agent activities
