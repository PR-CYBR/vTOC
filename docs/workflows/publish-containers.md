# Publish Containers workflow

The **Publish Containers** GitHub Actions workflow keeps the Docker images and compose manifest in sync with `main`, `live`, and tagged releases.

## Triggers
- `workflow_dispatch` with an optional `release_tag` input for ad-hoc promotions.
- Weekly scheduled run at 12:00 UTC on Mondays.
- `push` events targeting the `main` and `live` branches or tags matching `v*`.

## Required secrets and variables
- `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` is used by `Log in to GHCR`, `Upload compose manifest artifact`, and `Attach compose file to release` for registry and release access.
- No additional repository variables are required; tags are derived from the workflow context or the optional dispatch input.

## Jobs and major steps
### `tests` job
- Checks out the repository via `actions/checkout@v4`.
- Installs the frontend toolchain in `Set up pnpm`, `Set up Node.js`, and `Enable corepack` before running `Install frontend dependencies`.
- Runs the React test and build suites in `Frontend tests` and executes UI smoke coverage with `Playwright smoke tests`.
- Provisions Python in `Set up Python`, installs dependencies through `Install backend dependencies`, and executes API checks with `Backend tests`.

### `publish` job
- Normalizes the target registry name in `Lowercase image repository` and prepares QEMU/Buildx for multi-arch builds.
- Authenticates via `Log in to GHCR` and calculates version tags in `Compute image tags`.
- Builds and pushes the backend, frontend, and scraper images using the respective `Build and push â€¦ image` steps.
- Regenerates the docker compose manifest in `Generate compose manifest`, stores it via `Upload compose manifest artifact`, and attaches it to tagged releases with `Attach compose file to release`.

## Expected artifacts
- `Upload compose manifest artifact` publishes `docker-compose.generated.yml` for downstream deployment tooling.

## Common failure modes
- Test suites failing in `Frontend tests`, `Playwright smoke tests`, or `Backend tests` block the publish job because `publish` depends on `tests`.
- Registry authentication issues (`Log in to GHCR`) or insufficient permissions will prevent pushes and cause the build steps to fail.
- Missing or malformed `release_tag` inputs can surface in `Compute image tags`, yielding invalid tag sets and build failures.
- Changes that break compose generation cause `Generate compose manifest` to fail, preventing the artifact upload and release attachment steps.
