# Task authoring with Spec Kit

The `specs/<feature>/tasks/` directory stores Markdown cards that automation can
convert into GitHub issues, Codex prompts, or project items. Each card traces
back to a parent backlog item and inherits metadata from the feature plan.

## Workflow overview

1. **Start from a feature folder** — Every task belongs to a `specs/<feature>/`
   directory initialized via `/speckit.init`. Run `/speckit.tasks <feature>`
   after `/speckit.plan` completes so the generator has milestone details.
2. **Review generated cards** — The CLI writes task files named after the
   recommended swimlane (`backend-<slug>.md`, `frontend-<slug>.md`,
   `integration-<slug>.md`). Each file includes:
   - A `Backlog-ID` front matter field that links to `backlog/backlog.yaml`.
   - A `Workstream` tag (`backend`, `frontend`, or `integration`).
   - Acceptance criteria pulled from `spec.md` and `qa-checklist.md`.
3. **Customize as needed** — Add implementation hints, attach diagrams, or link
   to design assets. Avoid removing the autogenerated headers; automation parses
   them to sync with GitHub Projects.
4. **Publish** — Commit the tasks with your branch and run `/speckit.sync
   <feature>` so Codex and the project board pick up the new scope.

## Creating ad-hoc tasks

Occasionally you may need an auxiliary task that does not warrant a full spec.
Use `/speckit.tasks <feature> --ad-hoc "Rotate API keys"` to scaffold a single
card under the `integration/` swimlane. Update the `Backlog-ID` field to point
at the maintenance backlog item, commit the file, and sync.

## Template reference

Task files follow this structure:

```markdown
---
Backlog-ID: BL-123
Workstream: backend
Assignees:
  - github:octocat
Labels:
  - priority/medium
  - speckit
---

## Summary
Short description of the change.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Criteria imported from spec or plan
- [ ] Add any manual validation steps

## Links
- Spec: ../spec.md
- Plan: ../plan.md
- QA: ../qa-checklist.md
```

Keep sections intact so downstream tooling can parse them deterministically.
