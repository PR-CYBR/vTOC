# Multi-Platform Bot Integration Plan (Archived)

> **Status:** Archived in favor of the Spec Kit directories under `specs/`. Use the resources below for authoritative planning, research, and rollout material.

## Spec Kit Index

| Backlog ID | Feature | Spec Kit Directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bot-integrations-shared` | Shared bot infrastructure, clients, and observability | [`specs/001-bot-integrations-shared/`](../../specs/001-bot-integrations-shared/) |
| `bot-telegram` | Telegram management bot | [`specs/002-bot-telegram/`](../../specs/002-bot-telegram/) |
| `bot-slack` | Slack monitoring bot | [`specs/003-bot-slack/`](../../specs/003-bot-slack/) |
| `bot-discord` | Discord operations bot | [`specs/004-bot-discord/`](../../specs/004-bot-discord/) |
| `bot-docs-qa-rollout` | Documentation, QA, and rollout program | [`specs/005-bot-docs-qa-rollout/`](../../specs/005-bot-docs-qa-rollout/) |

Each directory contains `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`, and `contracts/` materials generated with the `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, and `/speckit.tasks` commands. Historical checklist content remains available in repository history if required.

## Using the New Specs
- Start with `spec.md` for scope, goals, and architectural context.
- Review `plan.md` and `tasks.md` to understand implementation sequencing and work breakdown.
- Consult `quickstart.md` for local setup and validation steps; `contracts/` capture cross-team agreements and integration guarantees.
- `research.md` highlights references and outstanding questions to resolve during execution.

Please update this index if new bot-related backlog items gain Spec Kit coverage.
