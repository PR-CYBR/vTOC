# vTOC Documentation

Welcome to the vTOC knowledge base. This site assembles the existing Markdown content in the `docs/` directory and publishes it through MkDocs so that contributors can explore the project architecture, interfaces, deployment guidance, and operating procedures from a single entry point.

Use the navigation menu to jump to quickstart material, operational runbooks, hardware documentation, and design references. New documents that are added under `docs/` will automatically appear in the published site when the Pages workflow runs.

For local previews run `mkdocs serve` from the repository root (see the workflow README on the `pages` branch for more details).
